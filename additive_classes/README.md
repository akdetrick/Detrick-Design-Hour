# Additive Classes

This example demonstrates an approach to handling styling of an element that changes states or variants.

We define styles shared by all states with a base class, and use separate classes to apply variant-specific styles.

This example also introduces the [`classcat`](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/classcat) utility for building `className` strings.
